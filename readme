Description: This Python script reads the content of a text file, stores it in a JSON file, and then displays the content from the JSON file.

## Instructions

1. Place the text file you want to convert in the same directory as this script.

2. Run the script using Python (json_dump_and_load.py()).

3. The script will read the content of the text file, store it in a JSON file named `text_string.json`, and display the content.

4. If the text file is not found or there is an issue with the JSON encoding, appropriate error messages will be displayed.

## File Details

- `readTextFile`: Reads the content of the specified text file.

- `storeTextFileInJson`: Reads the text file content and stores it in a JSON file.

- `displayTextFileFromJson`: Reads and displays the content from the stored JSON file.

## Notes

- Make sure to adjust the file names or paths in the script according to your requirements.

- This script uses exception handling to provide informative error messages in case of issues.

- Ensure that the text file contains valid content that can be successfully loaded into JSON format.
